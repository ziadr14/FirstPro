This project is a simple application for displaying products interactively and efficiently.
It allows users to browse products, view their details, and possibly add them to a shopping cart.

Interactive Interface:

A fast and smooth design powered by Angular.

Using REST APIs :

If APIs are utilized, product data is fetched directly from a server.

Product Details Page:

When a user clicks on a product, a detailed page appears showing additional information (e.g., specifications, reviews, etc.).

Search and Filter:

Users can search for a specific product or filter products based on price or category.

Technologies Used:

Bootstrap or Material UI can be added to enhance the appearance.

JSON (Product Data):
